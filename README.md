# Wallpaper-Change
A Python script which chooses an image at random from a folder named 'Wallpapers' and sets it as desktop background. Then it sends the image to another folder named 'Applied', which is located in the 'Wallpapers' folder itself, so that the background is not repeated. Once all the images from 'Wallpapers' folder have been applied, it moves all the images from the 'Applied' folder back to 'Wallpapers' folder, and repeats the cycle. The additional GUI feature lets you decide when to change the wallpaper!
